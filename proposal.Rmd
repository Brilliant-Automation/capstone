# Executive Summary

Brilliant Automation, a leader in industrial automation solutions, has engaged our team to develop an intelligent monitoring and predictive maintenance system for industrial equipment. This project will leverage advanced data analytics and machine learning to transform sensor data into actionable insights, supporting early fault detection and optimized maintenance for key machinery.

# Introduction

Brilliant Automation specializes in advanced monitoring and control systems for manufacturing and processing plants. To maximize equipment reliability and operational efficiency, the company installs high-frequency vibration and temperature sensors at critical points on key machinery, such as motors, gearboxes and bearing housings, across their clients' facilities. These sensors continuously collect data to monitor the health of essential assets including Tube Mills, Belt Conveyors, and High-Temperature Fans.

This project aims to enhance their predictive maintenance capabilities. By leveraging advanced signal processing and machine learning, our system will enable early detection of equipment issues, reduce unplanned downtime, and optimize maintenance schedules. The solution will integrate sensor exploratory data analysis, machine learning predictions, and an intuitive visualization platform to help maintenance teams make informed decisions and deliver greater value to Brilliant Automation's clients.

The focus of our analysis will be on three key pieces of industrial machinery: a Tube Mill, Belt Conveyor #8, and High-Temperature Fan #1. Our solution will integrate sensor data analysis, machine learning predictions, and an intuitive visualization platform to help maintenance teams make informed decisions about equipment upkeep and repair scheduling.

## Context and Need

Manufacturing facilities face constant challenges in maintaining equipment reliability while minimizing maintenance costs. Current maintenance practices, which often rely on fixed schedules or reactive approaches, can lead to either unnecessary maintenance or unexpected breakdowns. Modern sensor technology and data analytics offer an opportunity to revolutionize this approach through data-driven decision making.

## Core Challenges

Our project addresses several key challenges in industrial maintenance:

1. Converting complex sensor readings into meaningful maintenance indicators
2. Establishing an objective system for equipment health evaluation
3. Building transparent and reliable prediction models
4. Creating an accessible interface for maintenance personnel

## Key Goals

We aim to achieve the following:

1. Data Analysis and Understanding:
   - Map relationships across different measurement types
   - Identify patterns in equipment behavior
   - Analyze vibration signatures and their implications

2. Health Assessment Framework:
   - Create a comprehensive scoring system
   - Implement real-time health monitoring
   - Ensure compatibility with maintenance standards

3. Predictive Modeling:
   - Develop transparent prediction systems
   - Enable early fault detection
   - Provide clear reasoning for predictions

4. User Interface Development:
   - Enable live monitoring
   - Present clear status indicators
   - Facilitate historical analysis

## Project Outputs

We will deliver:

1. An interactive dashboard powered by Python and Dash/Plotly
2. A robust data analysis pipeline
3. Validated predictive models
4. Complete system documentation
5. Technical presentation and detailed report

# Technical Approach
