## Proposal Report

To generate the proposal report as a PDF, ensure you have [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) installed. Then run the following command in your terminal from the root directory:

```
quarto render docs/proposal.qmd --to pdf
```

This will generate `proposal.pdf` in the `docs` directory.
