## Project Background and Objectives

### Business Context

Brilliant Automation specializes in advanced monitoring and control systems for manufacturing plants. Their client operates a limestone mining facility with critical equipment requiring continuous health monitoring to prevent costly breakdowns and ensure operational efficiency.

The existing system relied on proprietary MATLAB algorithms that generated health ratings from high-frequency sensor data. However, clients demanded transparency in rating calculations, driving the need for interpretable machine learning alternatives.

### Technical Challenge

The project addressed several interconnected challenges:

**Data Complexity:**

- Multi-frequency sensor data (5-second intervals) from 15 monitoring points
- Temporal mismatch with health ratings (20-minute intervals)
- High-dimensional feature space with multicollinearity issues

**Model Requirements:**

- Interpretability for industrial decision-making
- Accuracy matching existing MATLAB performance
- Real-time processing capabilities
- Scalability across multiple device types

**Operational Integration:**

- Seamless replacement of existing workflows
- Automated data processing pipeline
- User-friendly visualization and reporting

### Project Scope

Our deliverables encompassed three core components:

1. **Machine Learning Models:** Interpretable algorithms for predicting 12 health rating categories
2. **Interactive Dashboard:** Real-time monitoring interface with industry-standard visualizations
3. **Automated Pipeline:** End-to-end data processing and model deployment infrastructure

## Data Analysis and Understanding

### Data Architecture

The system processes data from three critical equipment types:

```{r}
#| label: data-architecture-table
#| tbl-cap: "Data Architecture Overview"

data_architecture <- data.frame(
  Equipment = c("Tube Mill", "Belt Conveyor #8", "High-Temperature Fan #1"),
  `Sensor Locations` = c("6 locations", "4 locations", "5 locations"),
  `Data Frequency` = c("5-second intervals", "5-second intervals", "5-second intervals"),
  `Rating Frequency` = c("20-minute intervals", "20-minute intervals", "20-minute intervals")
)

kable(data_architecture,
      booktabs = TRUE,
      col.names = c("Equipment", "Sensor Locations", "Data Frequency", "Rating Frequency")) %>%
  kable_styling(
    latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"),
    full_width = FALSE,
    position = "center"
  )
```

### Sensor Data Characteristics

Four key parameters monitored at each location:

```{r}
#| label: sensor-characteristics-table
#| tbl-cap: "Sensor Data Characteristics"

sensor_characteristics <- data.frame(
  Parameter = c("Low Frequency Acceleration", "High Frequency Acceleration",
                "Vibration Velocity Z", "Temperature"),
  Purpose = c("Detect alignment issues", "Identify friction problems",
              "Monitor system damage", "Prevent overheating"),
  `Maintenance Insight` = c("Mechanical wear patterns", "Bearing condition",
                           "Structural integrity", "Lubrication status")
)

kable(sensor_characteristics,
      booktabs = TRUE,
      col.names = c("Parameter", "Purpose", "Maintenance Insight")) %>%
  kable_styling(
    latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"),
    full_width = FALSE,
    position = "center"
  )
```

### Target Health Ratings

The system predicts 12 health rating categories (0-100 scale):

**Mechanical Condition Ratings:**

- Alignment Status, Rotor Balance, Fit Condition
- Bearing Lubrication, Rubbing Condition

**Vibration Analysis Ratings:**

- Velocity RMS, Peak Value Optimization
- RMS measurements (1-10kHz, 10-25kHz)
- Crest Factor, Kurtosis Optimization

**Overall Assessment:**

- 80-100: Healthy operation
- 60-79: Usable with monitoring
- 30-59: Warning - maintenance needed
- 0-29: Fault - immediate attention required

### Key Data Challenges Identified

**Correlation Issues:**

- Weak correlation between sensor inputs and target ratings (R² < 0.5 for most targets)
- High multicollinearity among input features (r > 0.95 between acceleration measurements)

**Temporal Misalignment:**

- 240 sensor readings per rating calculation
- Information compression required for meaningful feature engineering

**Data Quality:**

- Extreme outliers requiring robust preprocessing
- Missing temperature readings requiring interpolation
- Sensor location dependencies affecting feature distributions

## Technical Methodology

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline

**Temporal Alignment:**

1. Combined date/time columns into unified timestamps
2. Pivoted sensor data to feature columns by location
3. Forward-filled temperature readings for missing 5-second intervals
4. Aggregated 5-second sensor data to 20-minute windows for model training

**Feature Engineering:**

1. Statistical summaries (mean, std, min, max) for each 20-minute window
2. Location-specific feature encoding
3. Correlation-based feature selection to reduce multicollinearity
4. Outlier detection and treatment using IQR methods

**Data Validation:**

- Cross-validation splits preserving temporal ordering
- Stratified sampling ensuring representative target distributions
- Data leakage prevention through proper temporal boundaries

### Model Development Strategy

We evaluated multiple approaches balancing interpretability and accuracy:

```{r}
#| label: model-comparison-table
#| tbl-cap: "Model Comparison and Selection Criteria"

model_comparison <- data.frame(
  `Model Type` = c("Ridge Regression", "Polynomial Ridge", "Random Forest",
                   "XGBoost", "Support Vector Regression"),
  Interpretability = c("High", "Medium-High", "Medium", "Low", "Low"),
  Accuracy = c("Medium", "Medium", "High", "Very High", "High"),
  `Use Case` = c("Baseline linear relationships", "Simple non-linear patterns",
                 "Feature interactions", "Complex non-linear patterns",
                 "Kernel-based relationships")
)

kable(model_comparison,
      booktabs = TRUE,
      col.names = c("Model Type", "Interpretability", "Accuracy", "Use Case")) %>%
  kable_styling(
    latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"),
    full_width = FALSE,
    position = "center"
  )
```

**Model Selection Rationale:**

*Decision Tree-Based Models Preferred:*

1. **Threshold-based interpretability** - Natural fit for industrial fault detection
2. **Non-linear interaction capture** - Handle complex sensor relationships
3. **Robustness to outliers** - Critical for noisy industrial sensor data
4. **Implicit feature selection** - Automatic identification of important sensors

  `Target Rating` = c("velocity_rms_rating", "fit_condition_rating", "rms_1_10khz_rating",
                      "alignment_status_rating", "bearing_lubrication_rating"),
  `Best Model` = c("Random Forest", "SVR", "XGBoost", "Random Forest", "XGBoost"),
  RMSE = c(1.560, 1.769, 0.066, 2.997, 0.243),
  `R² Score` = c(0.471, 0.360, 0.328, 0.181, 0.154),
  Interpretation = c("Good predictive power", "Moderate accuracy", "Excellent precision",
                     "Challenging prediction", "High precision, low variance")
)

kable(model_performance,
      booktabs = TRUE,
      col.names = c("Target Rating", "Best Model", "RMSE", "R² Score", "Interpretation")) %>%
  kable_styling(
    latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"),
    full_width = FALSE,
    position = "center"
  )
```
