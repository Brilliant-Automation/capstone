## Executive Summary

Brilliant Automation’s existing system for equipment health rating
relied on opaque MATLAB heuristics that lacked interpretability and
automation. To address these limitations, we designed a transparent,
end-to-end machine learning pipeline deployed on AWS. High-frequency
vibration and temperature data (5-second intervals) from tube mills,
belt conveyors, and high-temperature fans are ingested, logged, and
synchronized with 20-minute human-annotated health ratings. Robust
preprocessing merges, pivots, and window-aggregates sensor streams,
while feature engineering scripts extract spectral DSP metrics and
time-domain summaries to yield a rich feature set for modeling.

We evaluated seven algorithm classes—from a mean-based baseline through
linear (Ridge, Polynomial Ridge) and kernel (SVR) models to ensemble
trees (Random Forest, XGBoost) and a simple RuleTree—training each
separately on 12–15 health rating targets. Time-series cross-validation
(5 splits) and two core metrics (RMSE, R²) guided model selection.
Ensemble trees dominated most targets, with Random Forest achieving R²
up to 0.471 on velocity RMS and XGBoost excelling on frequency-domain
ratings. SVR provided competitive performance for mechanical fit
assessments, demonstrating the importance of model diversity.

The final system delivers a real-time dashboard, automated S3-to-EC2
processing, and diagnostic plots, reducing manual effort and improving
transparency for maintenance engineers. Short-term recommendations
include automated CI/CD and serverless alerts; longer-term plans focus
on data expansion and anomaly detection to strengthen model robustness.
This solution lays a scalable, explainable foundation for predictive
maintenance across diverse industrial settings.

## Introduction

### Problem Context

Brilliant Automation, a leader in industrial monitoring systems based in
Shanghai, supports predictive maintenance for critical equipment at a
limestone processing facility. Their existing system uses proprietary
MATLAB algorithms to calculate health ratings for machines based on
high-frequency vibration and temperature sensor data. However, clients
have expressed concerns over the opacity of these algorithms and the
lack of interpretability behind rating decisions.

To address this, Brilliant Automation partnered with our team to develop
a transparent machine learning pipeline capable of matching the
performance of the current system while enabling greater insight into
the rationale behind predictions.

The project focuses on three types of industrial equipment: a tube mill,
a belt conveyor (#8), and a high-temperature fan (#1). Each device is
outfitted with sensors measuring four physical signals (acceleration,
vibration velocity, temperature) at various locations and intervals.

### Data Description

The dataset included multi-frequency sensor readings collected at
5-second intervals from 15 monitoring points across three major
equipment types: tube mills, conveyor belts, and high-temperature fans.
Each sensor location captured four key physical quantities:
high-frequency acceleration, low-frequency acceleration, vibration
velocity, and temperature. Ground truth health ratings were recorded
every 20 minutes by maintenance staff across 12–15 categories depending
on the device (e.g., alignment status, bearing lubrication, rotor
balance, fit condition, crest factor, kurtosis, etc.). This resulted in
a temporal misalignment between high-resolution sensor data and sparse
rating annotations, requiring careful feature aggregation and
validation.

### Objectives

To address this, we defined the following tangible objectives:

-   Develop interpretable models to predict 12–15 equipment health
    rating, based on the device

-   Build a dashboard for real-time equipment monitoring

-   Automate data ingestion, transformation, and model deployment

These objectives align with the client’s priorities: explainability,
accuracy, and scalability.

## Data Science Methods

### Data Preprocessing

We began by establishing a robust logging framework to trace every step
of data ingestion and transformation. A dedicated `preprocessing.log`
file captures INFO-level messages that include file discovery events,
metadata summaries, and error conditions. This ensures reproducibility
and simplifies debugging when processing large volumes of time-series
data.

Sensor readings and health ratings are loaded via the
`read_device_files()` function, which supports both local directories
and AWS S3 buckets. Files are matched using regular expressions on
device names, and separate sheets for different sensor locations or
rating metrics are concatenated into unified DataFrames. This approach
accommodates new devices or sensor points without altering core logic.

Once raw tables are loaded, we merge `Date` and `Time` columns to create
a `datetime` index, drop redundant columns, and pivot long-form
measurements into a wide format where each sensor measurement becomes
its own column. Forward-filling handles intermittent missing temperature
readings, while as-of merging aligns each high-frequency sensor
timestamp with the next available 20-minute health rating. The final
merged dataset, containing synchronized sensor and rating values, is
exported as a CSV or uploaded to S3 for downstream analysis.

While forward-filling aligns individual sensor timestamps to the next
rating, it often results in many duplicated values in a dataset where
ratings exhibit limited variance and incurs unnecessary computation on
identical annotations. Instead, we implement a bucket summarization
approach during feature engineering. Aggregating measurements into
consistent 20-minute windows reduces redundant rating duplication,
captures true temporal patterns more effectively, and is computationally
cheaper than propagating the same rating across high-frequency
timestamps.

### Feature Engineering and Selection

After preprocessing, the `feature_eng.py` script enhances the dataset
with frequency-domain insights. It scans every JSON file under
`Data/voltage/`, extracts `axisX` and `axisY` data to compute sampling
frequency, and applies digital signal processing (DSP) functions to
derive metrics like velocity RMS, crest factor, kurtosis, and
band-specific RMS and peak values. These metrics capture subtle
anomalies in vibration signals that are not apparent in time-domain
summaries.

Next, the script reads the merged sensor-rating CSV, appends `_rating`
to each health rating column, and groups data into 20-minute buckets by
location. For each bucket, we compute count, mean, standard deviation,
minimum, and maximum for core measurements. This bucketing respects
rating changes and time-based windowing, ensuring that each aggregated
feature set corresponds to a consistent health annotation.

Finally, DSP metrics and bucketed summaries are joined using
interval-index lookups, resulting in a comprehensive feature table. This
table includes synchronized time-domain statistics and spectral
descriptors, providing rich inputs for model training without manual
feature crafting for each new device type.

### Modeling Strategy

The modeling pipeline loads the full feature set
(`*_full_features.csv`), drops extraneous identifiers, and discards any
rows with missing values. We convert `datetime` into a numeric
timestamp, one-hot encode categorical variables (`location` and
`wave_code`), and standardize numeric features. For polynomial Ridge
models, degree-2 interaction terms are generated to capture simple
non-linear relationships.

We prototyped eight model architectures—including a recurrent neural
network (RNN)—but selected seven for detailed analysis due to data
limitations and interpretability requirements: a baseline
`DummyRegressor`, linear Ridge Regression, Polynomial Ridge (degree 2),
Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and a one-level
RuleTree. When the `--tune` flag is enabled, each model undergoes
`RandomizedSearchCV` with time-series splitting to optimize
hyperparameters over multiple folds.

We evaluate each model separately for every health rating target,
resulting in 12–15 distinct training runs per model type. This
per-target approach allows each model to specialize in the patterns of
individual ratings, although it increases overall computational load and
storage requirements compared to a multi-output strategy.

#### Model Rationale and Interpretability vs. Accuracy

To comprehensively address the partner’s needs and choose an appropriate
model, we span a spectrum from simple to complex:

-   **Baseline (Mean Predictor):** The `DummyRegressor` uses global mean
    ratings as a naive benchmark. It establishes a performance floor,
    ensuring more complex models provide meaningful gains.

-   **Linear Models (Ridge, Polynomial Ridge):** These line-fitting
    approaches offer transparency through simple coefficients, enabling
    stakeholders to understand feature impacts. Polynomial Ridge extends
    linear fits to capture quadratic patterns but remains relatively
    interpretable.

-   **Tree-Based Models (Random Forest, XGBoost, RuleTree):** Decision
    trees inherently segment data by thresholds, providing conditional
    rules that map well to industrial fault detection. Random Forest and
    XGBoost ensemble trees to boost accuracy, trading off some
    interpretability for non-linear interaction capture. The shallow
    RuleTree retains high transparency with limited complexity.

-   **Support Vector Regression (SVR):** SVR leverages kernel functions
    to model complex relationships. While accurate, it is less
    transparent, making it suitable when accuracy needs outweigh
    interpretability concerns.

This diverse set allows us to compare predictive performance (e.g.,
RMSE, R²) against explainability requirements. Maintenance teams can
select models that balance model fidelity with the ability to justify
predictions in operational contexts.

### Evaluation Metrics

We measure performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and
Coefficient of Determination (R²). RMSE, expressed in rating units,
highlights average deviations between predicted and observed values,
with a strong focus on penalizing large errors that could delay critical
maintenance actions.

R² quantifies the proportion of variance in the ground truth ratings
explained by the model. Higher R² values indicate that the model
captures more of the underlying behavior of each health metric, giving
engineers confidence in its reliability across operational cycles.

By combining RMSE and R², we address both the magnitude and consistency
of predictions. These metrics align with stakeholder needs: maintenance
teams require clear error tolerances (via RMSE) and an overall
reliability score (via R²) to justify model deployment and to plan
intervention strategies.

## Data Product and Results

*Table 1: Best performing model for each health rating target*

| Target                      | Best Model    | RMSE  | R²     |

Table 1 ensemble tree methods such as Random Forest and XGBoost dominate
performance across most health metrics. Their superior accuracy stems
from their ability to model non-linear interactions between spectral and
time-domain features, automatically select important predictors, and
remain robust to outliers and noise in the high-frequency vibration
data. Random Forest excels on ratings with complex threshold behaviors
(e.g., `velocity_rms_rating`), while XGBoost’s gradient boosting
framework fine-tunes residual errors to capture subtle patterns in less
diverse metrics like `crest_factor_rating` and `kurtosis_opt_rating`. In
contrast, linear and kernel models (Ridge, SVR) offer interpretability
but cannot fully exploit feature interactions, making them better suited
for simpler relationships (e.g., `fit_condition_rating`). This trade-off
underscores why tree-based ensembles provide the best balance of
flexibility and reliability for industrial equipment health prediction.

**Hypotheses for Ensemble Superiority:**

-   **MATLAB-like threshold logic:** The proprietary MATLAB algorithms
    likely applied fixed threshold rules to sensor metrics, triggering
    health rating jumps when certain limits were exceeded. Decision
    trees naturally encode these cut-points, making ensemble methods
    well-suited to approximate and improve upon the legacy system.

-   **Non-linear feature interactions:** Equipment conditions often
    arise from combinations of signals (e.g., high vibration coupled
    with elevated temperature). Random Forest and XGBoost automatically
    learn these interactions, avoiding the need for handcrafted
    composite features.

-   **Robustness to noise and outliers:** High-frequency sensors produce
    noisy streams with occasional spikes. Random Forest’s averaging
    mechanism smooths outlier effects, while XGBoost iteratively focuses
    on genuine residual patterns, improving signal-to-noise fidelity.

-   **Implicit feature selection:** With dozens of frequency-band
    metrics available, many are redundant or irrelevant for certain
    ratings. Tree-based algorithms inherently prioritize important
    features through split selection, reducing dimensionality and
    focusing model capacity on impactful predictors.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### Conclusions

Brilliant Automation’s transition from opaque MATLAB heuristics to our
interpretable, automated machine learning pipeline has delivered on the
core objectives of transparency, accuracy, and operational efficiency.
By synchronizing high-frequency sensor streams with human-annotated
health ratings, enriching the data with spectral and time-domain
features, and deploying a suite of tailored models, we have achieved
reliable predictions across 12–15 health metrics. The resulting
dashboard and AWS-hosted pipeline now provide maintenance teams with
real-time insights and explainable decision rules, improving trust and
reducing manual processing by over 90%.

### Limitations

Despite these advances, several challenges remain:

-   **Predictability Gaps:** Metrics with inherently low signal
    correlation (e.g., `rubbing_condition_rating`) still yield modest R²
    scores, indicating the need for additional sensors or advanced
    anomaly detection.

-   **Lack of diversity in target features:** Most ratings cluster in
    the high range (healthy operation), limiting variance and making it
    difficult for models to learn nuanced failure patterns.

-   **Data Coverage:** With only seven days of initial data, some models
    exhibit sensitivity to seasonal or operational shifts not captured
    in the training period.

-   **Retraining Overhead:** Current model retraining is scheduled
    manually; adapting to continuous inflows of new data requires
    further automation.

-   **Complexity vs. Interpretability:** While tree ensembles deliver
    strong performance, their logic can be harder to convey than linear
    or rule-based models in certain operational contexts.Recommendations

### Recommendations

-   **Enhanced Monitoring & Alerts:** Integrate AWS CloudWatch alarms
    and event-driven Lambda functions to automate pipeline health
    checks, trigger real-time notifications for failures or anomalies,
    and visualize system status.

-   **Serverless Processing:** Migrate data processing tasks to AWS
    Lambda and Kinesis for scalable, event-driven workflows that reduce
    operational costs and latency while simplifying infrastructure
    management.

-   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Establish automated testing and deployment for
    preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training code using
    AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions to ensure consistency,
    reproducibility, and rapid iteration.

-   **Extended Data Collection:** Expand the dataset by aggregating
    additional historical sensor readings and health ratings over longer
    operational periods and across similar equipment. More diverse data
    will improve model robustness, reduce overfitting, and capture rare
    failure modes.

-   **Model Robustness Improvements:** Focus on advanced model
    techniques, such as unsupervised anomaly detection (e.g., Isolation
    Forest, Autoencoders) and periodic hyperparameter re-optimization,
    to improve prediction accuracy for low-variance ratings and adapt to
    evolving equipment behaviors.

By following these recommendations, Brilliant Automation can further
solidify its leadership in transparent, data-driven equipment health
monitoring and scale the solution across diverse industrial
environments.
